Schema Classes

    Schema classes are at the heart of Gldapo. They represent a particular <kind> of entry in an LDAP directory.

    When schema classes are registered, extra behaviour is injected into these classes (via the {{{http://ldaley.com/injecto}Injecto}} framework).

    You can find a list of available methods {{{methodreference.html}here}}.
