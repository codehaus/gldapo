Gldapwrap is to LDAP what GORM is to relational databases (or at least tries to be). It essentially maps entries in a directory to Groovy objects.

Gldapwrap is written on top of the excellent Spring LDAP library.

For documentation see the examples directory and http://groovy.codehaus.org/Gldapwrap
